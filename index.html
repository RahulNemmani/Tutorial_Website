<h3>About me</h3>
<h4 class="animated bounceInLeft">Mathematics and Me</h4>
<p >
Hi! My name is Rakesh Sharma Nemmani. I am currently a senior at Mira Mesa High School. I am very passionate about helping other people especially
in education. Having completed all math courses up to Differential Equations, I am comfortable in helping students from grades K-12,
including the SAT/ACT as well. My strongest subject is math, where I will have completed the math courses at the end of the semester. I love to do
any type of math, whether it is traditional math or competitive math. I am the president of my high school's Math Club and I help my school's team to 
become proficient at the material as well.

</p>
<h4 class="animated bounceInLeft">School Life</h4>
<p >
Outside of math, I excel at other subjects as well. Throughout my high school career, I have only received As. I also love biology and chemistry after
math. After achieving a 5 on my AP Chemistry test, I became my AP Chemistry class's TA (Teacher Assistant) due to my passion toward Chemistry and 
teaching in general. I constantly love to challenge myself and have chosen the most rigorous courses on the menu. This has led to my higher GPA in
school: 4.66. I have taken a total of 10 AP Courses as of now. In addition to APs, I have taken a couple of college classes to my interest as well.
I have taken Introduction to Java, Calculus III (Multivariable Calculus), Linear Algebra, and am currently taking Differential Equations.







</p>
<h4 class="animated bounceInLeft">Extracurricular Activities</h4>
<p >
I am not just a book person, as one might expect. I love playing my violin, which I have been doing for the past 6 years, and I volunteer at a tutoring
center (Cambridge Learning Center) during the summer to refine my teaching skills. Other hobbies of mine include learning foreign languages and to rap.
I usually learn these languages from songs I love, usually Korean, Japanese, Mandarin, and French. I love to rap in different languages because I adore 
laying down bars while also learning what different words mean.  
</p>
