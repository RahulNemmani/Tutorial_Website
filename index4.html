<h4>Why I Want To Do This</h4>

<p>
As a kid, I could never a perfect tutor to help me out with my academic problems. My parents were not the most effective resource and my brother
was only a year older than me, knowing as much as me. I had to self-teach myself most of the material and growing up, I strived to help any kid who
seemed to be struggling. It even went to the point where I helped my opponent in a chess tournament tie with me when I was clearly winning the match.
I am frustrated to see people struggling and it triggers me when I do not help someone struggling when I know how to do it. This is how I work.

<p>
Students who enroll with me will be shown the most attention and they will successfully complete their curriculum. I have ensured that students 
have successfully finished their courses and are ready to move on to the next one. Students typically are satisfied with the way I teach yet
I am always striving to be better in what I teach. With this, I plan to see your child and help him out with most of, if not all of his academic
problems!
